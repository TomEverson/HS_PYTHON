# SMPL: SIMPLE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE FOR BEGINNERS

## THIS LANGUAGE IS MORE SMPLER THAN PYTHON, AND TURING COMPLETE

### Limitations ( For Me )

1. No Library ( Regex is Built-In Library For Python T_T )
2. No Lexing
3. Only Built-in Python Methods, and Data Structure

#### IT SUPPORTS

1. VARIABLES
   - NUMBERS
   - BOOLEAN
   - FLOATS
   - STRING
2. LOOPS
   - USE RECURSION xD
3. IF-ELSE CONTROL FLOWS ( Can't Do Nested )
4. FUNCTIONS

### VARIABLES

```
LET A BE 1
LET B BE "HELLO"
LET C BE 3.14
LET D BE FALSE

```
